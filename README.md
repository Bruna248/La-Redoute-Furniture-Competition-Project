Welcome to the La Redoute Furniture Competition Project, developed for the annual Laredout competition at the Polytechnic of Leiria. This project aims to revolutionize the way we visualize furniture by leveraging the power of 3D graphics and animations. Dive into an immersive web platform that showcases furniture in a way you've never seen before!

## Features 🌟

- **3D Visualization**: Experience furniture in three dimensions, giving you a holistic view of each piece.
- **Smooth Animations**: Watch as each furniture piece comes to life with smooth and realistic animations.
- **Interactive UI**: Engage with the platform, rotate, zoom, and explore each furniture piece in detail.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

This project is powered by [Three.JS](https://threejs.org/), a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.
